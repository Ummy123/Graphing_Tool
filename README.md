Basic graphing tool

About The Project: Simple graphing tool for linear and quadratic equations

Prerequisites: -python version 3.9 
               -matplotlib

Restrictions: Reflected quadratic functions as well as logarithmic, sinusoidal, and rational functions will not work. Reflected linear functions will work. If you find any more functions that will not work, please let me know. Only basic functions will work. Use spaces between each item and use double astriks instead of "^" for exponents. From what I have tested, linear, simple quadratics, and exponential functions will work.
